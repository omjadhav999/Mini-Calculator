# Mini-Calculator

## Introduction

This C++ program is a mini calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It prompts the user to enter an operator and two numbers, then displays the result of the operation.

## Features

- Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
- Provides basic error handling for division by zero.
- Simple command-line interface for ease of use.

## Complexity

- The program is straightforward and operates in constant time (O(1)) for each arithmetic operation. Input and output operations are also minimal, making it efficient for basic calculations.
